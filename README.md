# Hi, I’m Aránzazu Galvaliz or @aranza318 for the GitHub friends👋
## Are you wondering who I am? Well let me tell you a bit about me 👇 
As a recently graduated full stack developer and in my first stages of
learning I am a professional in programming that is looking to improve
on my hard skills since I have the knowledge, but I would like be able
to implement them and continue developing in the both Front-End and
Back-End sectors. I'm looking for improvements in my skills and
gaining experience in the labor field. I love learning new things and I
am always open to new adventures.
